------Installation Guildlnes------
If you have webgl installed(all browsers have it installed), double click on the index.html and it should work fine.

------About the Project----------
This was the first Assigned Project that we had to submit individually. We had to create a static 2d image of the favourite place from our DAIICT campus. I chose my hostel room. There was extra credits for animation and sound.

-There were few things which I had in my mind when I started this project and they were-
    -Detailing
    -Color Combination
    -Changing window
    -Keeping it as real as I could

- I have not used any external js libraries, but for me the highlight would be the fractal tree that  you can see from the window. I used the basic algorithm to create it and tweaked some details as per my liking.

Tools and Technologies: Webgl,HTML,CSS

-------Experience-----------
    - Since it was my first time working with webgl, I searched a lot. I started with basics. Creating basic objects.
    - Once I was able to draw basic objects I started with shading and using colors to enhance the effects.
    - After that I structured my image in such a way that if you break it down all the peices work as independent objects and if you put them together they create the image.
    i.e., you can us chairs, cupboards, tables, beds and floor as seperate objects.
    - I had such a great time working on this as I love coding and also this brought out my creativity which I think would be very helpful.

-------Feedback--------------
    - Since it is my work, I can not be the judge of it. So feel free to share your feedbacks with me on my socials.
